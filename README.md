# Recommended Steps
- Run 'Splitting data into training, validation and testing.ipynb' in the 'preprocessing' folder via 'code' folder before the following steps. 

## Mandatory Tasks
Run 'our_algorithm.ipynb' in the 'modelling' folder via 'code' folder. It also contains a checking script to check for bugs.

## Data Analysis and Algorithm analysis
Run 'analysis.ipynb' in the 'analysis' folder via 'code' folder. 

## Bonus Task 
Run 'Bonus.ipynb' in the modelling folder via 'code' folder. It contains the Bonus Task algorithm.
<br />Run 'Bonus_revenue.ipynb' in the modelling folder via 'code' folder. It shows the revenue with the predicted spot price from 1/7/2021 to 11/8/2021(Same time period as the mandatory testing dataset).
